# EthernautLevels

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x9CB391dbcD447E645D6Cb55dE6ca23164130D008)

## Ethernaut
The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.
Are you interested in smart contract development or security? Does securing the world’s blockchain infrastructure sound exciting to you?

## What you will see here
